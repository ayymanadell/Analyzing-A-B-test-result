# Analyzing A/B Test Results 

## Overview
Welcome to the Analyzing A/B Test Results project! In this project, we analyze the results of an A/B test to understand the effectiveness of a new webpage design compared to the old design. By performing statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, we aim to determine whether the new design leads to a significant improvement in user engagement and conversion rates.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about user's interactions with the old and new webpage designs. It includes data on user IDs, timestamps, group assignment, and the outcome of each user's interaction (e.g., converted or not converted).

## Features
This project explores the following key features:

- User group assignment (control group vs. treatment group).
- User engagement metrics (e.g., time spent on page, clicks, conversions).
- Timestamps to track the duration of the A/B test.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is an essential step to ensure the dataset is free from errors and inconsistencies. In this project, we handle missing values, remove outliers, and prepare the data for statistical analysis.

## Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis involves hypothesis testing and comparing the performance of the old and new webpage designs. We use inferential statistics, such as Z-tests or t-tests, to determine if there is a significant difference in user engagement and conversion rates between the two groups.

## Results
The results of the A/B test analysis will indicate whether the new webpage design leads to a statistically significant improvement in user engagement and conversion rates. We'll interpret the findings and discuss their implications for decision-making.
